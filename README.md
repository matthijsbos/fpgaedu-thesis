## Abstract
This thesis proposes a model for the application of FPGA development boards as a tool for experimentation with digital logic. This model adopts the concept of an address space as a means for isolation of board-specific components in the logic's architecture, as well as a means for generalization of experiment setup interaction. This subsequently allows for the reuse of a number of architectural components across different projects as well as for the automation of different parts of the development process. As a result, the process for development of new FPGA configurations is shortened and reduced in terms of complexity.
